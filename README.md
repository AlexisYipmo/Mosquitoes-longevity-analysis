Mosquitoes Longevity Analysis after exposure to bednets

Mosquitoes have been exposed to 02 bednets (Bednet1 and Bednet2) for 05 min. After exposure, we count daily death in each group : 
Control = group of non exposed mosquitoes
BDN1 = Group of Mosquitoes exposed to Bednet1
BDN2 = Group of Mosquitoes exposed to bednet2

We then want to know if there is a difference in term of survivability in each group (Control, BDN1 and BDN2)
